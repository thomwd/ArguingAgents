Input:
Complete argument
Arguments one by one in real time
Arguments consist of:
        The argument (small text)
        The source of the argument
        Whether it rebuts/undercuts any arguments
        Whether it supports any other arguments
        Weight/credibility
        Which conclusion it supports
Arguments can be saved in xml-files.
Agents can maybe have a label that determines their credibility
Input can also consist of constraints?


Parameters:

        Can use different methods to decide what the outcome of the argument is like:
        
        Method of evaluation can differ based on the argument setting

        Not sure if leaving the weights out will lead to sensible conclusions

        Which conclusion is true (and perhaps to what degree)
An argumentation scheme
